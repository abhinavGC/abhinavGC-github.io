This includes text, images, and any other controls. The control uses element virtualization, so it always loads quickly, even when populated with hundreds of items.\r\n\r\n* **Time-tested, Familiar Object Model** - ComboBox has a rich object model. You can easily specify whether the end user is able to enter items that are not on the drop-down list, get or set the index of the selected item, the height of the drop-down list, and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
